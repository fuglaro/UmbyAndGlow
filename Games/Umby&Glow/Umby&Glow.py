"""
The dolphins sold our planet? What for?!
Mock tuna.
Mock tuna?
Yeah, synthesized tuna. They even thought they got the better deal. After the fish were wiped out, to the dolphins, the planet was just a big rock. From their point of view, they sold the aliens a rock for tuna.
Gah! Tricky Blighters!

Good thing we live near a SpaceY launch pad.
We live near a SpaceY launch pad?
Literally like every 3 weeks or so, the whole cave shakes itself half loose, and you always ask "Whats that?", and I always say "The downside of living near a SpaceY facility"
Cool! Lets roll.


Time to eat the frog!
Eat the frog? - Do you mean: Try to do something impossible but by never giving up, eventually succeed?
Yes. Eventually the worm eats everything.
