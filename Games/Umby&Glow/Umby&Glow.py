## Tape Management ##

class Tape:
    """
    Scrolling tape with a fore, mid, and background layer.
    This represents the level of the ground but doesn't include actors.
    The foreground is the parts of the level that are interactive with
    actors such as the ground, roof, and platforms.
    Mid and background layers are purely decorative.
    Each layer can be scrolled intependently and then composited onto
    display buffer.
    Each layer is created by providing deterministic functions that
    draw the pixels from x and y coordinates. Its really just an elaborate
    graph plotter - a scientific calculator turned console!
    The tape size is 64 pixels high, with an infinite length, but only
    72 pixels wide buffered.
    This is intended for the 72x40 pixel view. The view can be moved
    up and down but when it moves forewards and backwards, the buffer
    is cycled backwards and forewards. This means that the tape
    can be modified (such as for explosion damage) for the 64 pixels high,
    and 72 pixels wide, but when the tape is rolled forewards, and backwards,
    the columns that go offscreen are reset.
    There is also an overlay layer and associated mask, which is not
    subject to any tape scrolling or vertical offsets.
    """

    # Layers each have 1 bit per pixel from top left, descending then wrapping
    # to the right.
