1 - player can switch characters (hold both buttons)
2 - 2 players connect if devices have different characters

Umby and Glow save their cave.

1.1) Umby, Glow in cave, with monsters and traps being about.
1.2) Umby and Glow find monsters have infiltrated their cave.
1.3) They suspect it is Lung.
1.4) They decide to find out where they have come from.
1.5) They leave their cave.

Suspect bad worm
Follow monsters to alien spaceship
Find Lung held hostage
Lung gives info as sacrifice
Flood spaceship mainframe
Go back home
Cave -> forest -> air -> rocket -> space -> spaceship -> spaceship computer mainframe -> dolphin aquarium -> flooded spaceship -> forrest -> cave
