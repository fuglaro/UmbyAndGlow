## Script and Level Progression ##

from monsters import *
from patterns import *

_DIALOG_DISPLAY_FRAMES = const(180)

##
# Script - the story through the dialog of the characters.
# Script data includes the (additive) tape scroll amount for when
# each line of the script occurs and the dialog itself.
# Each entry is usually one line of dialog, but can also include naration
# or other messaging, or even level details. Each line of script
# includes a prefix indicating the character that says the line:
#     "@:" -> Umby says this (overlay at bottom of screen)
#     "^:" -> Glow says this (overlay at top of screen)
#     "" (no prefix) -> Narration (written to middle of background)
# The script can also include level changes which takes the form of a
# tuple with the following form:
#    (feed, spawner)
# E.g:
#    # Level: Cave filled with Bones
#    (
#     # (back, mid-back, mid-back-fill, foreground, foreground-fill)
#     [pattern_toplit_wall,
#      pattern_stalagmites, pattern_stalagmites_fill,
#      pattern_cave, pattern_cave_fill],
#     # Reset monster spawner to the new level
#     (bytearray([Bones]), bytearray([200])))

# Story WIP and Ideas
#
###
### # TODO turn story into script
# TODO: Create bosses for all levels
###
#Umby and Glow save their cave.
#
#1.1) Umby, Glow in cave, with monsters and traps being about.
#1.2) Umby and Glow find monsters have infiltrated their cave.
#1.3) They suspect it is Lung.
#1.4) They decide to find out where they have come from.
#1.5) They leave their cave.
#
#Suspect bad worm
#Follow monsters to alien spaceship
#Find Lung held hostage
#Lung gives info as sacrifice (he will be flooded out - no time to save)
#Flood spaceship mainframe
#Go back home
#Cave -> forest -> plains -> space y -> rocket -> space -> spaceship ->
#    spaceship computer mainframe -> dolphin aquarium ->
#    flooded spaceship -> forrest -> cave
###
#
# Take your time, you don't want to be the early worm.
#
#"""
#The dolphins sold our planet? What for?!
#Mock tuna.
#Mock tuna?
#Yeah, synthesized tuna. They even thought they got the better deal. After the fish were wiped out, to the dolphins, the planet was just a big rock. From their point of view, they sold the aliens a rock for tuna.
#Gah! Tricky Blighters!
#
#Good thing we live near a SpaceY launch pad.
#We live near a SpaceY launch pad?
#Literally like every 3 weeks or so, the whole cave shakes itself half loose, and you always ask "Whats that?", and I always say "The downside of living near a SpaceY facility"
#Cool! Lets roll.
#
#
#Time to eat the frog!
#Eat the frog? - Do you mean: Try to do something impossible but by never giving up, eventually succeed?
#Yes. Eventually the worm eats all.
