### Bones is a monster that flyes about then charges the player.
# Bones looks a bit like a skull.
# It will fly in a random direction until it hits a wall in which case
# it will change direction again. There is a very small chance that
# Bones will fly over walls and ground and Bones will continue until
# surfacing. If Bones goes offscreen to the left + 72 pixels, it will die;
# offscreen to the top or bottom plus 10, it will change direction.
# It will also change direction on occasion.
# When the player is within a short range, Bones will charge the player
# and will not stop.
