## Story data file ##

##
# Script - the story through the dialog of the characters.
# Script data includes the (additive) tape scroll amount for when
# each line of the script occurs and the dialog itself.
# Each entry is usually one line of dialog, but can also include naration
# or other messaging, or even level details. Each line of script
# includes a prefix indicating the character that says the line:
#     "@:" -> Umby says this (overlay at bottom of screen)
#     "^:" -> Glow says this (overlay at top of screen)
#     "" (no prefix) -> Narration (written to middle of background)
# The script can also include level changes which takes the form of a
# tuple with the following form:
#    (feed, spawner)
# E.g:
#    # Level: Cave filled with Bones
#    (
#     # (back, mid-back, mid-back-fill, foreground, foreground-fill)
#     [pattern_toplit_wall,
#      pattern_stalagmites, pattern_stalagmites_fill,
#      pattern_cave, pattern_cave_fill],
#     # Reset monster spawner to the new level
#     (bytearray([Bones]), bytearray([200])))
# Or as a number, which will load the relevant monster directly.

# Story WIP and Ideas
#
#Umby Space Y
#
#Rocket ship
#Rocket ship has left and right wall monsters that have specific attacks that just keep the worms in the center (need to detect which monster hits a player).
#Left and right walls shut, keeping the player inside. Cant see outside.
#Background layer monsters can be seen outside, along with clouds and stars. At different rates, they fall down the screen. (Use a bones that explodes on contact with ground - for use elsewhere - maybe another level? Maybe on the return home (because they are falling out of the sky? - fast but doesnt kill worm, just knocks them back and destroys land)
#
#Leading to rocket - boxes piled on ground. Jumping monster?
#
#After launch - rocket destroyed by aliens.
#
#
#----
#Rockets in background
#Countdown to doors closing.  If you don't make it, it's reset. Doors bounce you back off. "Umby was too slow"
#
#Doors shut locking you in and you can see from outside that the rocket is lifting off.
#Monsters get denser, stars start to show. Dialog at **timed intervals**. Needs timer events in dialog queue.
#Death behaviour changes to not scroll back (based on "spaced" variable). Instead, holds worm in middle vertical spot for a while then places on platform on same horizonal position.
#
#Falling monsters and stars are controlled by the right door. That does all the work and timings. This way, everything outside can shake during liftoff.
#
#Monsters start falling down.
#
#^: Woaaaah! Here we go!
#@: Brace yourself, Glow!
#^: I'm hard stuck to this beam. Make sure youre good too, Umby!
#@: Thanks! These G's are only increasing. I'm well planted!
#
#Monsters get faster.
#
#
#
#----
#Level with monster wall that chases you is after the aquarium is destroyed, and a wall of water and monsters rushes after you and you are escaping the exploding ship.
#Lots of stompers to navigate.
#
#----
#Space
#
#Mon: alien with tentacles like an octopus.
#Head is separate sprite to tentacles. Both animate separately, and their position animates relative to each other.
#
#Umby and Glow behave differently:
# - Glow has no gravity but still wall crawls
# - Umby has very low gravity moving downward.
#
#Normal gravity returns when getting on the alien ship.
#
#
#
#
###
### # TODO turn story into script
# TODO: Create bosses for all levels

#
# Worm loves worm (referenced and credited)
#Suspect bad worm
#Follow monsters to alien spaceship
#Find Lung held hostage
#Lung gives info as sacrifice (he will be flooded out - no time to save)
#Flood spaceship mainframe
#Go back home
#Cave -> plains -> forest -> plains -> space y -> rocket -> space -> spaceship ->
#    spaceship computer mainframe -> dolphin aquarium ->
#    flooded spaceship -> forest -> cave

# Take your time, you don't want to be the early worm.
#
#"""
#The dolphins sold our planet? What for?!
#Mock tuna.
#Mock tuna?
#Yeah, synthesized tuna. They even thought they got the better deal. After the fish were wiped out, to the dolphins, the planet was just a big rock. From their point of view, they sold the aliens a rock for tuna.
#Gah! Tricky Blighters!
