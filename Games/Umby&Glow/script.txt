## Story data file ##

##
# Script - the story through the dialog of the characters.
# Script data includes the (additive) tape scroll amount for when
# each line of the script occurs and the dialog itself.
# Each entry is usually one line of dialog, but can also include naration
# or other messaging, or even level details. Each line of script
# includes a prefix indicating the character that says the line:
#     "@:" -> Umby says this (overlay at bottom of screen)
#     "^:" -> Glow says this (overlay at top of screen)
#     "" (no prefix) -> Narration (written to middle of background)
# The script can also include level changes which takes the form of a
# tuple with the following form:
#    (feed, spawner)
# E.g:
#    # Level: Cave filled with Bones
#    (
#     # (back, mid-back, mid-back-fill, foreground, foreground-fill)
#     [pattern_toplit_wall,
#      pattern_stalagmites, pattern_stalagmites_fill,
#      pattern_cave, pattern_cave_fill],
#     # Reset monster spawner to the new level
#     (bytearray([Bones]), bytearray([200])))
# Or as a number, which will load the relevant monster directly.

#Yeah, synthesized tuna. They even thought they got the better deal. After the fish were wiped out, to the dolphins, the planet was just a big rock. From their point of view, they sold the aliens a rock for tuna.
